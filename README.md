# CNN_CIFAR-10_Recognition

### Image Recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset.

I used Google Colab for this analysis. The personal computer CPUs can not handle the computation required to train a CNN model. Colab, however is equipped with GPUs that are optimised for these tasks.

This CNN-based classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset achieved a test accuracy of 82%, which can be further improved by adding more layers, using data augmentation, adjusting the hyperparameters (like epoch number of 100), or employing more advanced architectures like Residual Networks (ResNet).
